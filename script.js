//EXERCISE 1: The Fortune Teller
//Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself? Store the following into variables: 
//job title, geographic location, annual salary, company name. Output your fortune to the console like so: "You will be a X in Y, making $N for Z."

//EXERCISE 2: The Age Calculator
//Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it! Store the current year in a variable. Store their birth year in a variable. 
//Calculate their age based on the stored values. Output them to the console like so: "They are NN years old.", substituting the values.

//EXERCISE 3: The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more! Store your current age into a variable. 
//Store a maximum age into a variable. Store an estimated amount per day (as a number). Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life. Output the result to the console like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

//EXERCISE 4: The Geometrizer
//Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here. Store a radius into a variable. 
//Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN". Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

//EXERCISE 5: The Temperature Converter
//It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here. Store a celsius temperature into a variable. 
//Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".  Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable. Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."





// EXERCISE 1
// Write a function named squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), 
//square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like 
//"The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."


// EXERCISE 2
// Write a function named halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".


// EXERCISE 3
// Write a function named percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."


// EXERCISE 4
// Write a function named areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
//      Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.


// EXERCISE 5
// Write a function named runAll that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier
//      1. Take half of the number and store the result.
//      2. Square the result of #1 and store that result. 
//      3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.   
//      4. Calculate what percentage that area (#3) is of the squared result (#2).
